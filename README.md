This includes notable projects such as the HR Analytics Job Prediction project, where I used machine learning models to predict and analyze data related to HR in order to identify the reasons why employees leave. I used several models and the results are as follows:

Logistic Regression
The logistic regression model achieved a precision of 80%, a recall of 83%, an F1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and an accuracy of 83% on the test set.

Tree-based Machine Learning
After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved an AUC of 93.8%, a precision of 87.0%, a recall of 90.4%, an F1-score of 88.7%, and an accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. The random forest model slightly outperformed the decision tree model.


In the Taxi_fare_LinearRegression project, I used the Linear Regression model to predict and analyze the taxi fare price based on the impact of the travel distance and the duration of the trip, using the 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv dataset.

In this Taxi_tip_using_RandomForest project, I will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.
The purpose of this model is to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.
The goal of this model is to predict whether or not a customer is a generous tipper.
